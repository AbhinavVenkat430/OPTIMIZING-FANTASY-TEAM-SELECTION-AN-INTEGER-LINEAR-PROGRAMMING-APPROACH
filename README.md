# Optimizing-Fantasy-Team-Selection-An-Integer-Linear-Programming-Approach
Master's Thesis
# Abstract 
A fantasy sport league is an online game where participants assume the role of team managers, thoughtfully selecting real players to form their virtual teams. The allocation of points to each team is based on the actual performance of these selected players in real-life sports events. The primary goal for every manager is to conclude the season with the highest points possible, aiming for victory. Among the largest leagues globally is the Fantasy Premier League (FPL), which boasts an impressive participation ofapproximately 7 million players from around the world. The characteristics and rules of the FPL are thoroughly discussed, delving into the meticulous process 
of player choice, scoring systems, and budget constraints that heavily influence the strategic decisions made by team managers. Building upon these valuable insights, a mixed-integer linear programming model is introduced, specifically designed to optimize team selection each week with the goal of achieving the maximum points possible. The model's construction involves the use of retrospective data from a season, allowing for precise mathematical determination of the best scoring team for each week.To demonstrate the model's practicality and effectiveness, data from the 2022/23 FPL season is utilized, and the model is executed on IBM ILOG CPLEX. The results obtained are thoroughly analysed 
and discussed, presenting a clear showcase of the model's potential in real-world scenarios.
