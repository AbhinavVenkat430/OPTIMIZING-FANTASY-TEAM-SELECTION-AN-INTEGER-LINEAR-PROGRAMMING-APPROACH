# Optimizing-Fantasy-Team-Selection-An-Integer-Linear-Programming-Approach
Master's Thesis
# Objective & Impact
Among the multitude of fantasy sports leagues, Fantasy Premier League (FPL) stands out as the largest and most prominent, boasting an extensive following of approximately 7 million participants worldwide. This fantasy league operates in tandem with the top-tier of English football, the English Premier League. FPL commands unparalleled attention and fervent engagement from football enthusiasts, transcending geographical boundaries. This dissertation seeks to conduct a comprehensive analysis and optimization of team selection in the context of fantasy football, with a specific emphasis on the Fantasy Premier League (FPL). The strategic decisions made by managers in assembling their fantasy teams are significantly shaped by various pivotal factors. These factors encompass guidelines for player selection, budgetary limitations that impose constraints on the total team cost, and the intricacies of scoring systems that attribute points based on players' performances, goals, assists, clean sheets, and other relevant criteria. The presence of such constraints poses intriguing challenges for FPL managers, compelling them to devise the most efficient and high-scoring teams on a week-to-week basis.
To achieve this goal, a mixed-integer linear programming model is presented that enables us to formulate an innovative approach for generating and analysing retrospective results for any given FPL season. 


# Research Questions
Utilizing retrospective data from past seasons, the model allows us to tackle the following problems â€“
1. What was the best-performing teams for each game week of the season?
2. What was the maximum possible score that was theoretically possible at the end of the season?

# Outcome

The model consistently outperformed weekly winners with its team selections, accumulating 3872 points by the end of the season. This impressive score was 1096 points higher than the winner of the 2022/23 Fantasy Premier League season demonstrating its ability.
